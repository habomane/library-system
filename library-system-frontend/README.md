# Community Library

Have you ever enjoyed a book so much so that you wanted to allow another person to read it? Or maybe, you didn't enjoy the book but now it's just sitting on your desk with absolutely no use. Community Library allows users to share books among their community and/or give away books that others might find more love for. 

### Features 

#### Search For Books

As long as users have the book posted, users will be able to search the book title, author, and/or the location to identify the target book. Users can then coordinate among themselves to share the books as needed. 

#### Read reviews 

Users are able to leave reviews for books listed by leaving a review. 

#### Post books 

Users can post any books they have as well as their availability.
